If any one superstar symbolizes WCEWF, it's the Edwardtaker.
<br>
For more than 11 months, the Edwardtaker has been a WCEWF main eventer. 
He's feuded with all the greats -- from Whiteamania to Stoned Cold Steve Collie and yes even the peoples JAVA -- 
and lived to brag and carry on randomly. 
<br>
<br>
The Edwardtaker has also been at the forefront of some of the most original matches and concepts in WCEWF history. 
He is the innovator of Backyard Matches, Classrooom Matches, and, of course, the famed Hell in the Commen Room Match.
<br>
<br>
Although he has been cheered for most of his career, the fans have begun to boo the Waiukuan Badass as of late. Taker has 
been on a constant conquest for respect, and that has come at the expense of some of the most popular superstars in sports 
entertainment. If any man has earned respect over the past 11 months, it's the Edwardtaker -- and he's determined to make the 
fans show him some respect.
