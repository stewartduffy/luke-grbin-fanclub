<br>
King Raj achieved his greatest success on 8th June, 2002, when he defeated everyone for the 
most coveted status in waiuku, and was named King of the ball. 
<br>
<br>
He unified the his "KING" status by using his "RAJ Privileges" when he felt the need.
<br>
<br>
But his ultimate dream, and quest, he has yet to fulfill. He one day dreams of going to university, 
waikato as his first choice, and get a degree. We all live to see tha day.
