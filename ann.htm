	<br>One of the most sultry divas in the history of sports-entertainment, Ann Marie has already made quite a name for 
	herself in WCEWF. Her beauty is second to none, but her brains are brawn which hold her back from being the total package.
	<br>
	Stratus made her first appearance in WCEWF just prior to WrestleMania 2001. She started off as the "Manager" 
	of former wrestler Arron "DA BARRON" Javis AKA The Peoples Java. The pair split after there personal affares caused him the 
	WCEWF Interstinktatude championship, and lose his job.

	<br>She spent a lot of time after that in self correction's and rehab trying to get her self togeather.

	<br>
	After laying low for a while, Trish made her next big bang at the 2002 Unforgettable, capturing the Women's Championship.
	Then went on to bruttally attack the Edwardtaker in reteleation from a underhanded prank, he pulled on her, that forced 
	her away for so long. It seems that Marie is on top of the Edwardtaker's game -- and she's determined not to let anyone 
	knock her up!
